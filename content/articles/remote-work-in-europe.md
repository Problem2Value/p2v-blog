## 1. Stop the Busy-ness

Replace the "time spent at the office" with judging, measuring and rewarding the actual value of the work. Without any strict "office hours", workers will no longer need to fill their days with stuff just to appear busy all the time. With everyone acting busy, many offices have always been a place of distractions where it was near impossible to get actual stuff done.

Make a clear switch by firmly putting the focus on tasks rather than time. Everyone’s calendar should be private, to avoid replicating this busy-ness game in a distributed workplace. Switch from padding calendars with Zoom meetings to sharing task lists to show who is working on what.

An unfortunate side effect with a lack of clear office hours is that some people are actually working longer and risk burning out. So, set shared working hours and never expect or contact people outside these to allow and encourage people to truly switch off.

## 2. Support Hybrid Workplaces

It appears that many workers enjoy working from home and will prefer to continue to do so. The time and energy saved by avoiding a daily commute to the office has been a blessing. Productivity has also shown that for most things it doesn't matter where the work is done. Companies will need to seriously rethink not only how much space they need, but also where spaces is needed and what function the spaces should serve.

Provide access to satellite offices closer to where workers live or grant access to co-working spaces. Especially for those who don't have a quiet, dedicated work space at home.

Whilst most work can be perfectly done remotely, being in the same room will greatly benefit certain work activities. Repurpose some office space for these types of group activities.

The workplace is for many also a place to connect socially with colleagues. Get teams together in-person on a regular basis. A strong personal connection between team members builds trust and boosts future virtual collaboration. Since a lot of work is done remotely, these get-togethers should focus on team building and having a bit of fun.

## 3. Embrace Diversity

Attract talent based on aptitude, communication skills and relative time zone. A much larger talent pool, without requiring a relocation to a commutable distance from the office, also has the potential to really boost diversity. Workers can be fluid in their locations on where to live, impacting their cost of living and quality of life.

Europe is a melting pot of rich cultures a numerous languages. Establish English - the de-facto international business language - as a common working language and provide tools to better document and communicate.

Written versioned documentation enables asynchronous work and provides a transparent record what work was done and the available information used to make certain decisions.
