# P2V Blog
This is a place where we first transferred our existing articles from Medium and from this point forward will post our future articles.

This blog was created by ourselves after some self learning the Vue JavaScript framework and Nuxt.js and hosted as a headless CMS, JAMstack on Netlify. We used it a bit as a playground to try and build stuff quickly and have a bit of fun along the way.

Since we borrowed lots of stuff from others we decided to make it open source too, so feel free to copy whatever you like.
